# Introduction
MBTModelGenerator is a software tool for automated generation of Model-based Test (MBT) models for web applications using clickstream data.

The current implementation of MBTModelGenerator generates MBT models to be imported and executed in the [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.github.io) open-source MBT tool.

The first version of the tool was released in May 2022. We may add more features to the tool in the future.
